            <p> In exploring, New York City and its extensive building population, 
                Community Board 301 was chosen as the region
                of study due to its large Old Law Tenement population. As presented in
                <a href="url">Project 1,</a> this map displays all buildings and
                identifies whether the building is an Old Law Tenement, is a site for Construction Activity,
                is a site Adjacent to Construction Activity, or has filed a Complaint.
