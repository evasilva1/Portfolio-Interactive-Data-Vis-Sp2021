# Reflection
Outline the major design decisions you made for your visuals, explain how you got there and why you picked them.
If you were to develop your own design process, how would it differ or mirror the design process taught in class?
What was the most helpful thing you learned from your projects?
How did the critiques affect your project and how you think about it?
How did your final project differ from the prospectus you outlined?
What were your major challenges? How would you mitigate them with your next project?
What came easier, or more naturally, than what you expected?
If you had more time and resources, what would you add/remove/change about your projects?
