In this portfolio you will find the sketches, drafts, data, code, and documentation for each project. At the end, you will find a reflection on my process and thoughts regarding the labs and projects. 

## Projects
For my projects, I chose to talk about the High Risk Assessment of 19th Century Buildings in New York City. These buildings, categorized as Old Law Tenements by New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), exist within the 1.1M New York City Building Population and pose a risk to the public. When analyzing incidences taking place in these 19th Century Buildings— buildings that were not intended to last more than fifty years, but continues to stand one-hundred-forty years later— it is evident that this population needs to be monitored. With a number of cases showing that these buildings have become structurally compromised due to adjacent construction, my objective is to build a case for the proactive monitoring and protection of these buildings and to create a tool that will help identify the locations Old Law Tenements adjacent to construction.
