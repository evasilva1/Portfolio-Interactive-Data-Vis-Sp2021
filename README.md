# Portfolio-Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2021
Exploratory + Narrative Visualization Projects for DATA 732000 [Interactive Data Visualization]

In this portfolio you will find the sketches, drafts, data, code, and documentation for each project. At the end, you will find a reflection on my process and thoughts regarding the labs and projects. 

## Projects
For my projects, I chose to talk about the High Risk Assessment of 19th Century Buildings in New York City. These buildings, categorized as Old Law Tenements by New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), exist within the 1.1M New York City Building Population and pose a risk to the public. When analyzing incidences taking place in these 19th Century Buildings— buildings that were not intended to last more than fifty years, but continues to stand one-hundred-forty years later— it is evident that this population needs to be monitored. With a number of cases showing that these buildings have become structurally compromised due to adjacent construction, my objective is to build a case for the proactive monitoring and protection of these buildings and to create a tool that will help identify the locations Old Law Tenements adjacent to construction.

| Project | Title | Summary |
| ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Project 1 | The High Risk Assessment of Old Law Tenements | Project 1, includes a map, a bar-graph and a line-graph to explain the incidences taken place in Old Law Tenements, a breakdown of the Old Law Tenement population per Borough, and Construction Permits over Time to explain the importance and risks Old Law Tenement present when structurally compromised.
| Project 2 | Demo: Community Board# 301 | Project 2, includes an interactive map of Community Board 301 (Brooklyn, New York). This map allows the user to interact and locate buildings and their proximity to construction sites. It includes the classification of the 301 building population, whether it is an Old Law Tenement or not. The objective is so that the user can get a visual representation of the location of this specific population and relative distance to construction.

## Data
Most of the data used for the projects was obtains from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). An exception would be the descriptsion used for the Incidence Map, which were taken from a private database.
